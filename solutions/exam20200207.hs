Consider a data type PriceList that represents a list of items, where each item is associated with a price, of type
Float: data PriceList a = PriceList [(a, Float)]

1) Make PriceList an instance of Functor and Foldable.
2) Make PriceList an instance of Applicative, with the constraint that each application of a function in the left hand
side of a <*> must increment a right hand side valueâ€™s price by the price associated with the function.

E.g.
PriceList [(("nice "++), 0.5), (("good "++), 0.4)]  <*> PriceList [("pen", 4.5), ("pencil", 2.8), ("rubber", 0.8)]

is:
PriceList [("nice pen",5.0),("nice pencil",3.3),("nice rubber",1.3),("good pen",4.9),("good pencil",3.2),("good rubber",1.2)]

  -- fs <*> xs = pConcatMap (\f -> fmap f (changep fs xs)) fs where
  --  changep -- this can't work because I can change prices on single list but not the combination

-- looked at solution and realized that you need a special fmap just for that reason, which also takes a price into account.
-- that special function is called pmap, added above. Now we can define apply:
  (PriceList fs) <*> xs = pConcatMap (\ff -> let (f,v) = ff in pmap f v xs) fs -- didn't completely understand the lambda he used here but it works
